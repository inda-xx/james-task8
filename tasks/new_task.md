### 🎮 Programming Task: Building a Simple Game Application

In this task, you will develop a small game application that incorporates player movement, a scoring system, and enemy interactions. The project will be divided into a series of exercises that will guide you through using data from files to instantiate objects, designing classes, and programming creatively. This task will enhance your understanding of Java programming and object-oriented design.

---

### 🚀 Exercise 1: Theoretical Concepts of File Data Handling

**Objective:** Deepen your understanding of using data from files to instantiate objects.

- **📄 Task 1.1:** Explain different file formats and their parsing techniques. Discuss how you might read data from each format in Java.
  
- **🔍 Task 1.2:** Analyze and describe the classes and methods available in Java for file I/O operations. Discuss the importance of handling exceptions during file operations.

**Deliverable:** A written report detailing the above points, including potential code snippets for illustration.

---

### 📚 Exercise 2: Theoretical Concepts of Class Design

**Objective:** Develop an understanding of class design principles.

- **🔧 Task 2.1:** Define the responsibilities and interfaces of classes `Player`, `Enemy`, and `GameWorld`. Discuss the role of each class and how they interact.
  
- **♻️ Task 2.2:** Investigate commonly used design patterns. Choose a pattern that could enhance the design of your game and explain why.

**Deliverable:** A diagram depicting the class design along with descriptions of each class and their relationships.

---

### 💻 Exercise 3: Initial Code Implementation

**Objective:** Start coding to integrate the theoretical concepts previously studied.

- **📝 Task 3.1:** Create a `GameDataLoader` class that reads player and enemy data from files and instantiates corresponding objects.

- **👨‍🔧 Task 3.2:** Implement basic class structures for `Player` and `Enemy`, including fields for attributes like position and health.

**Code Snippet:**

```java
public class GameDataLoader {
    public void load(String filename) throws IOException {
        // Implement file reading and object instantiation
    }
}

public class Player {
    private String name;
    private int health;
    private int score;
    // Constructors, getters, and setters
}
```

**Deliverable:** Functional code for reading and instantiating objects using file data.

---

### ✨ Exercise 4: Expanding Class Functionality

**Objective:** Add more functionality to your game classes and integrate them into the gameplay.

- **🏃 Task 4.1:** Enhance the `Player` class to include movement capabilities and an updating score system.

- **👾 Task 4.2:** Implement basic interactions between `Player` and `Enemy` objects. For instance, decrease player's health when it collides with an enemy.

**Code Snippet:**

```java
public void move(int dx, int dy) {
    // Update position based on movement
}

public void collideWith(Enemy enemy) {
    // Interaction logic when colliding with an enemy
}
```

**Deliverable:** Updated `Player` and `Enemy` classes with interactive behaviors.

---

### 🎯 Exercise 5: Creative Integration

**Objective:** Combine every aspect learned to create a functional game loop.

- **🔄 Task 5.1:** Design a `GameWorld` class. This class should manage game objects, handle the game loop, and implement rules for starting and ending the game.

- **⚖️ Task 5.2:** Incorporate user input for controlling the player and add a basic console interface for player interactions.

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **Setup Game Initialization:** Initialize game objects and load data.
2. **Start Game Loop:** Repeatedly update the game state, checking for player input and collisions.
3. **Display Updates:** Print the current state of the game to the console.
4. **End Conditions:** Define rules for game-over scenarios and final scoring.

```java
public class GameWorld {
    private List<Enemy> enemies;
    private Player player;

    public void run() {
        // Implement game loop with input handling
    }

    // Additional game logic
}
```

**Deliverable:** A complete, functional game that can be played using console input.

---

### 🎉 Exercise 6: Final Touches and Enhancements

**Objective:** Perfect your game by refining the gameplay and implementing optional features.

- **🖼️ Task 6.1:** Add file saving functionality to record high scores.
  
- **🎨 Task 6.2:** Implement additional player abilities, such as power-ups or special attacks, to enhance gameplay.

- **👂 Task 6.3:** Gather feedback and conduct testing to further refine and optimize your game.

**Deliverable:** An enhanced version of your game incorporating new features, providing an engaging user experience.
