# 🎮 Task: Build a Simple Game Application with Java

In this task, you will create a simple game application with functionalities like player movement, a scoring system, and enemy interactions. The project will teach you how to use data from files to instantiate objects, design classes effectively, and apply creative programming techniques to solve problems.

## 🏁 Exercise 1: Understanding File Data and Parsing Techniques

### 📄 Aim:
This exercise focuses on understanding file formats and parsing techniques to extract data that can be used to instantiate objects. 

### ⚙️ Instructions:
1. **Conceptual Understanding**: 
   - Explain the importance of reading data from files in programming, particularly in gaming applications. Why might a game need to read settings, levels, or character data from a file?
   - Discuss different file formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, XML) and their use cases in gaming.

2. **Parsing Techniques**: 
   - Describe a method for parsing a simple CSV file containing game levels.
   - What are some pitfalls of parsing and how can you ensure data integrity?

## 💡 Exercise 2: Class Design Principles

### 📄 Aim:
Explore the principles and practices of designing well-structured Java classes for game development.

### ⚙️ Instructions:
1. **Defining Class Responsibilities**:
   - Discuss how you would define the responsibilities of classes in a simple game (e.g., Player, Enemy, GameEngine).
   - Explain the concept of class interfaces and why they are important.

2. **Class Cohesion and Design Patterns**:
   - What is class cohesion and how does it affect game design?
   - Identify a design pattern that could be useful in this game application and justify your choice.

## 🛠 Exercise 3: Implementing Data-Driven Object Instantiation

### 📄 Aim:
Apply the concept of reading data from files to instantiate objects within your game.

### ⚙️ Instructions:
1. **Create a Level Loader**:
   - Write a Java class `LevelLoader` that reads level configurations from a file named `levels.csv`. Each row represents a level with attributes like enemy count, player starting position, etc.
   - Utilize Java’s file I/O classes to read the file and instantiate a list of `Level` objects.

```java
public class LevelLoader {
    private List<Level> levels;

    public LevelLoader(String filename) {
        // Load levels from the file
    }

    public List<Level> getLevels() {
        return levels;
    }
}
```

2. **Instantiate Level Objects**:
   - Ensure that the file reading process includes error checking (e.g., handling missing values or incorrect formats).
   - Instantiate `Level` objects using the parsed data and store them in the `levels` list.

## 🔄 Exercise 4: Designing Core Game Classes

### 📄 Aim:
Combine the principles of class design to implement core components of the game.

### ⚙️ Instructions:
1. **Player and Enemy Classes**:
   - Design and implement the `Player` and `Enemy` classes with attributes like position, size, and health.
   - Include methods for movement and interactions.

2. **Scoring System**:
   - Create a `ScoreManager` class that tracks the player’s score. Design it to update scores based on game interactions, like defeating enemies.

---

## 🚀 Exercise 5: Integrating Game Components

### 📄 Aim:
Create a basic game loop and integrate player movement, enemy interactions, and scoring into the application.

### ⚙️ Instructions:
1. **Game Loop Implementation**:
   - Implement a basic game loop in the `GameEngine` class that updates the game state, processes player input, and renders the game.

```java
public class GameEngine {
    private Player player;
    private List<Enemy> enemies;

    public void run() {
        while (true) {
            // Update game state, process input, and render
        }
    }
}
```

2. **Integrate Components**:
   - Ensure player movement and scoring system updates are operational within the loop.
   - Handle enemy interactions, such as collision detection and updating health.

## 🎯 Exercise 6: Enhancing the Game with Creative Features

### 📄 Aim:
Apply creative programming techniques to enhance game functionality and user experience.

### ⚙️ Instructions:
1. **Feature Enhancement**:
   - Add a feature of your choice to the game. This could be power-ups, new enemy types, or additional player abilities.
   - Experiment and iterate to refine your solution.

2. **Feedback and Iteration**:
   - Test your game with peers and gather feedback.
   - Based on feedback, make improvements to enhance gameplay and usability.
