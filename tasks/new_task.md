## üéÆ Task: Develop a Simple Game Application

Welcome to this engaging programming task where you will create a simple game application. The game will include essential functionalities such as player movement, a scoring system, and interactions with enemies. This project will help you master crucial skills: using data from files to instantiate objects, designing classes, and programming creatively. Let's dive into the exercises!

### üéØ Learning Goals:
- **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects**
  - Understanding file formats and parsing techniques for data extraction.
  - Using file I/O classes to read data and convert it into object attributes.
  - Handling exceptions and ensuring data integrity during object instantiation.
  
- **Designing Classes**
  - Identifying class responsibilities and defining clear interfaces.
  - Implementing cohesive class structures with appropriate fields and methods.
  - Leveraging design patterns to solve common problems and enhance class design.
  
- **Programming Creatively**
  - Exploring different approaches to problem-solving and algorithm design.
  - Encouraging experimentation and iteration to refine solutions.
  - Integrating user feedback and testing to improve program effectiveness and usability.

## üìù Exercise 1: Understanding File Data for Game Components
**Objective:** Explore how to use file data to create dynamic game elements.

- Discuss how different file formats (e.g., JSON, CSV) can be used to load game configurations, enemy stats, or levels.
- Suggest parsing techniques for extracting such data and initializing game objects.
- Research common exceptions that might occur in file I/O operations and propose strategies for handling them.

---

## üí° Exercise 2: Theoretical Class Design
**Objective:** Deep dive into the principles of effective class design.

- Analyze the responsibilities and interfaces needed for primary game classes like `Player`, `Enemy`, `GameLevel`.
- Discuss how to ensure that each class has a single responsibility and cohesive structure.
- Identify design patterns (e.g., factory, singleton) applicable to games and provide examples of their use.

## üî® Exercise 3: Coding Player and Enemy Classes
**Objective:** Implement core game classes based on theoretical designs.

- **Task:** Create Java classes for `Player` and `Enemy`.
  - Implement necessary attributes (e.g., position, health) and methods (e.g., move, attack).
  - Ensure data from a configuration file is used to instantiate these classes with initial attributes.
  
```java
public class Player {
    private int health;
    private Position position;

    public Player(String configFile) {
        // Read data from configFile to initialize player attributes
    }

    public void move(int x, int y) {
        // Implement movement logic
    }
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Exercise 4: Implementing a Scoring System
**Objective:** Add a scoring mechanism with dynamic updates.

- **Task:** Design a `Score` class that:
  - Tracks player's score through actions like defeating enemies or collecting items.
  - Uses data from a file to set point values for different actions.
  - Provides methods to update and display the score.
  
```java
public class Score {
    private int points;

    public Score(String configFile) {
        // Load point values from the configFile
    }

    public void addPoints(int points) {
        // Update total score
    }
}
```

## üöÄ Exercise 5: Creating Game Levels from Files (Challenging)
**Objective:** Use data-driven design to dynamically create game levels.

- **Task Part 1:** Design a `GameLevel` class that:
  - Reads level configurations from files.
  - Instantiates different enemies and items based on the level file data.
  
```java
public class GameLevel {
    private List<Enemy> enemies;

    public GameLevel(String levelFile) {
        // Parse levelFile to create enemies and items
    }
}
```

- **Task Part 2:** Handle file parsing errors gracefully and implement fallbacks (e.g., load default level).

---

## üéØ Exercise 6: Implementing Player and Enemy Interactions (Challenging)
**Objective:** Enable complex game interactions fostering creative programming skills.

- **Task Part 1:** Enhance player and enemy classes with interaction methods:
  - Implement combat mechanics where players can attack enemies and vice-versa.
  - Allow classes to read specific combat properties from configuration files for dynamic attribute allocation.

- **Task Part 2:** Integrate user feedback.
  - Allow players to test different strategies and receive real-time feedback within the game.
  - Use this feedback to iterate on your design, improving mechanics and balance.

```java
public class Interaction {
    public void engage(Player player, Enemy enemy) {
        // Implement interaction logic (e.g., health reduction based on attack power)
    }
}
```

By completing these exercises, you will gain a deeper understanding of file I/O for dynamic data handling, class design for maintainable and scalable systems, and creative problem-solving for an enhanced gaming experience. Enjoy your coding adventure! üéÆ‚ú®
