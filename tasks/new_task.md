# 🎮 Create a Simple Game Application

Welcome to the game development task! Your objective is to create a simple interactive game application that involves player movement, a scoring system, and enemy interactions. Throughout this task, we will delve into several key programming concepts: using data from files to instantiate objects, designing classes effectively, and embracing creative programming.

This task is structured into six exercises, gradually increasing in complexity, allowing you to build a solid foundation and then apply these concepts in an engaging way.

## Learning Goals

- **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects**
  - Understand file formats and parsing techniques.
  - Use file I/O classes to read data and instantiate objects.
  - Handle exceptions and ensure data integrity during object creation.
  
- **Designing Classes**
  - Identify class responsibilities and define clear interfaces.
  - Implement cohesive class structures with appropriate fields and methods.
  - Leverage design patterns for problem-solving and enhancing class design.

- **Programming Creatively**
  - Explore different approaches to problem-solving and algorithm design.
  - Encourage experimentation and iteration to refine solutions.
  - Integrate user feedback and testing to improve program effectiveness and usability.

## 📚 Exercise 1: Understanding File Data and Object Instantiation
### 🌟 Goal: Grasp the Conceptual Foundations

*Theory-focused*

In this exercise, you will explore the theoretical aspects of using data from files to create objects in Java.

### **Task:**

1. **Describe** the process of reading data from a file and converting it into object attributes. Include an explanation of different file formats (e.g., CSV, JSON) and parsing techniques.
   
2. **Discuss** the potential challenges and benefits of using files to drive object instantiation in a game development context. 

---

## 📘 Exercise 2: Class Design Principles
### 🌟 Goal: Understand Class Structure and Design

*Theory-focused*

Expand your understanding of designing robust class structures, an essential skill in any object-oriented programming task.

### **Task:**

1. **Explain** the role of class interfaces and how they contribute to the maintainability and scalability of a software system.
   
2. **Identify** a common design pattern (e.g., Singleton, Factory) and describe how it could be useful in designing game components such as players, enemies, or items.

## 👨‍💻 Exercise 3: Initialize Game World from File
### 🌟 Goal: Implement Data-driven Object Creation

*Practical Exercise*

Leverage your theoretical knowledge to implement a system that reads game configuration from a file.

### **Task:**

1. **Create** a method `loadGameWorldFromFile(String filename)` in Java, which reads a configuration file to instantiate game elements like players, enemies, and items. The file should include entries for each entity and its attributes.

2. **Implement** exception handling to ensure data integrity and manage potential file I/O errors gracefully.

```java
private void loadGameWorldFromFile(String filename) {
    // Outline your approach for reading the file, parsing data, and creating objects
}
```

---

## 💻 Exercise 4: Designing Game Classes
### 🌟 Goal: Apply Class Design Principles

*Practical Exercise*

Build on your understanding of class design by designing core components for your game.

### **Task:**

1. **Design** and implement a `Player` class, an `Enemy` class, and a class of your choice (e.g., `Item`). Ensure that your classes have clear responsibilities and interfaces.

2. **Document** your designed classes using Javadoc, providing a comprehensive overview of their purpose and functionality.

---

## 🚀 Exercise 5: Implementing Basic Game Mechanics
### 🌟 Goal: Develop Interactive Features

*Advanced Exercise*

Combine your understanding of data-driven instantiation and class design to create a functional game loop.

### **Task:**

1. **Implement** a simple game loop that allows the player to move through the game world, interact with enemies, and update their score based on game actions.

2. **Integrate** the designed classes into a cohesive game system, ensuring seamless interaction between objects.

```java
public class GameLoop {
    public void start() {
        // Set up initial conditions and start the main game loop
    }
}
```

## 🎯 Exercise 6: Creating a Full Game
### 🌟 Goal: Complete and Polish Your Game

*Creative and Complex Task*

This final exercise ties together all the previous tasks into a complete and polished game application. This is where creativity meets technical skill.

### **Task:**

1. **Enhance** your game by adding additional features such as power-ups, new enemy types, or different levels. Use your creativity to make the game engaging.

2. **Test** the game thoroughly, incorporating user feedback to refine game mechanics and improve the user experience.

3. **Document** your project extensively, including a README with game instructions, key features, and how the code is organized.

---

### 🌟 Submission Checklist
- [ ] Ensure all methods feature comprehensive Javadoc comments.
- [ ] Include a README file detailing game mechanics, setup instructions, and play tips.
- [ ] Attach any diagrams or notes that illustrate your design process or game map.
- [ ] Test your game thoroughly to catch and resolve any bugs or issues.
