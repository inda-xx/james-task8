## üéÆ Game Development Task: Simple Game Application

Welcome to this exciting programming task where you will design and implement a simple game application. This project will challenge your understanding of object-oriented programming concepts while encouraging creative thinking and experimentation. The game will include player movement, a scoring system, and enemy interactions. The core learning goals you will achieve are:

- **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects**
- **Designing Classes**
- **Programming Creatively**

### Task Breakdown

The complete task is divided into six exercises. These gradually increase in complexity to bolster your understanding step-by-step. Begin with theoretical discussions before moving on to practical implementation.

---

### üìù Exercise 1: Exploring Data from Files

**Objective**: Understand file formats and techniques for parsing data to instantiate objects. Answer theoretical questions to ensure comprehension.

1. **Question**: Discuss various file formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, XML) suitable for storing game data and explain how you would parse data from these formats in Java.
2. **Question**: Describe how you would handle potential exceptions when reading from a file. Why is it essential to manage these exceptions appropriately?

*No coding is required for this exercise, but ensure you have a robust theoretical understanding.*

### üîç Exercise 2: Conceptualizing Class Design

**Objective**: Identify class responsibilities and draft interfaces for your game‚Äôs main components.

1. **Task**: List potential classes you might need to develop a simple game application (e.g., Player, Enemy, GameWorld) and briefly describe each class's responsibility.
2. **Task**: Discuss how design patterns (such as Singleton, Factory, or Observer) could be employed to enhance your class design.

*Focus on clear and practical class designs that support scalability and maintenance.*

### üíª Exercise 3: Implementing File-Based Object Instantiation

**Objective**: Use Java to read player data from a file and instantiate Player objects.

1. **Code Task**: Create a class `PlayerLoader` that reads player attributes from a `players.txt` file. Each line should contain player data, such as `Name, Score, PositionX, PositionY`.
   
   ```java
   public class PlayerLoader {
       private ArrayList<Player> players;

       public PlayerLoader(String filename) {
           // Load player data from file and instantiate Player objects
       }

       public ArrayList<Player> getPlayers() {
           return players;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Code Review**: At this point, ensure your code handles exceptions and validates the data.

*This exercise encourages using data to dynamically create objects, critical for game dynamics.*

### üß© Exercise 4: Designing the Game Classes

**Objective**: Write Java classes for game entities and integrate file-read data for instantiation.

1. **Implementation**: Create a `Player` class with attributes such as `name`, `score`, `positionX`, and `positionY`. Include methods for movement and scoring.
2. **Implementation**: Develop an `Enemy` class with methods for interaction with the player.

*Design cohesive and well-structured classes based on tasks from Exercise 2. Avoid keeping business logic within the main method.*

```java
public class Player {
   private String name;
   private int score;
   private int positionX;
   private int positionY;
   
   // Constructor, getters, and relevant methods
}
```

### üèóÔ∏è Exercise 5: Integrating and Testing Game Functionality

**Objective**: Integrate all components and ensure they work harmoniously to provide base gameplay functionality.

1. **Integration Task**: Write a `GameWorld` class that initializes with player and enemy objects. Implement methods to simulate player movement and enemy interactions.
   
2. **Interactive Task**: Design a simple text-based test to demonstrate the functionality, such as moving a player and encountering an enemy.

```java
public class GameWorld {
   private List<Player> players;
   private List<Enemy> enemies;

   public GameWorld(String playerDataFile, String enemyDataFile) {
       // Initialize players and enemies
   }

   public void simulate() {
       // Basic interactions and movement
   }
}
```

---

### üé® Exercise 6: Creative Enhancements and Final Testing

**Objective**: Utilize creativity to enhance the game, refining algorithms and user experience.

1. **Creative Task**: Implement additional features such as score tracking, power-ups, or varied enemy behaviors. Iterate based on test outcomes.
2. **Feedback Loop**: Test with a peer and incorporate feedback to optimize gameplay mechanics, enhancing engagement and enjoyment.

*Focus on creativity, allowing your game to become more engaging and demonstrating problem-solving skills in development.*
