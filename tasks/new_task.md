## 🎮 Game Development Challenge: Build a Simple Interactive Game

Welcome to the Game Development Challenge! In this task, you will embark on the exciting journey of creating a simple game application that includes player movement, a scoring system, and enemy interactions. The game will employ object-oriented programming principles to create a maintainable and dynamic application. Your game should creatively use data from files to influence gameplay, offering a unique experience every time it's run.

### Learning Goals

- **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects** 📜: Learn how to read and parse data from files, transforming this information into dynamic in-game objects.
- **Designing Classes** 🧩: Understand effective class design, focusing on responsibility, cohesion, and leveraging design patterns for structure.
- **Programming Creatively** 🎨: Explore different programming strategies, experiment with solutions, and integrate user feedback to hone your game.

### Exercise 1: Understanding File Formats and Parsing Techniques 📂

- **Objective**: Deepen your understanding of how file data can be used to generate dynamic game objects.

1. **Theoretical Exploration**: 
   - Research common file formats used for storing game data (e.g., JSON, CSV). Discuss the pros and cons of each format in terms of complexity, ease of parsing, and data integrity.
   
2. **Parsing Techniques**:
   - Describe how you would parse a simple file format (such as JSON) to extract data for game entities like enemies or items.

### Exercise 2: Responsibilities and Interfaces in Class Design 🏗️

- **Objective**: Reflect on how to design game-related classes with clear responsibilities and interfaces.

1. **Class Responsibilities**:
   - Identify and describe the responsibilities of three core classes in any game (e.g., `Player`, `Enemy`, `GameManager`). How do these classes interact with one another?

2. **Interface Design**:
   - Create an interface for one of these classes, outlining its essential methods and expected behaviors.

### Exercise 3: File I/O and Object Instantiation in Practice 🔄

- **Objective**: Implement basic file reading mechanisms to instantiate game objects dynamically.

1. **Code Implementation**:
   - Create a class `GameDataLoader` that reads enemy data from a file and instantiates `Enemy` objects. Example file format (CSV):
     ```
     id, name, health, x, y
     1, Goblin, 100, 5, 10
     2, Troll, 150, 10, 20
     ```

   ```java
   BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("enemies.csv"));
   String line;
   while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
       // Parse line and instantiate Enemy objects
   }
   reader.close();
   ```

2. **Handle IO Exceptions**:
   - Ensure you correctly handle exceptions such as `FileNotFoundException` and maintain the integrity of game data during loading.

### Exercise 4: Designing and Coding Player Movement 🚶‍♂️

- **Objective**: Create a class for player movement, integrating dynamic input and real-time interaction.

1. **Player Class Implementation**:
   - Design a `Player` class with methods to move up, down, left, and right. Utilize keyboard input for movement.

2. **Dynamic Interaction**:
   - Write a loop to read player input and update the player’s position on a simple grid.

   ```java
   Player player = new Player();
   // Example movement loop
   // Pseudo-code for handling user input and moving the player
   ```

### Exercise 5: Crafting the Scoring System and Enemy Interactions 🏆❌

- **Objective**: Develop a simple scoring system linked to enemy interactions.

1. **Scoring Implementation**:
   - Add a scoring system within the `Player` class. Each enemy interaction should adjust the score (e.g., +10 points per enemy defeated).

2. **Integrate with Enemy Class**:
   - Modify your `Enemy` class to interact with the player, triggering events when enemies are 'defeated' by an attack method.

---

### Exercise 6: Designing Game Loop and Integrating Features 🔄🎮

- **Objective**: Combine all elements to create a seamless game loop.

1. **Game Initialization**:
   - Establish a main `Game` class that initializes the player, loads enemies from a file, and sets up the game loop.

2. **Game Loop Implementation**:
   - Within the game loop, handle player input, update enemy states, process interactions, and render the current game state.

   ```java
   while (!gameOver) {
       // Process input
       // Update game state
       // Render graphics
   }
   ```

3. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Allow for user testing to gather feedback, evaluate game mechanics for balance, and iterate on your loop design.
