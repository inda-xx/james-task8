### üéÆ Task: Develop a Simple Game Application with Player Movement and Enemy Interactions

Welcome to this exciting programming task where you'll harness your creativity to develop a simple game application. This task will guide you through the process of using data from files to instantiate objects, designing classes, and creatively solving problems in game development.

#### Learning Goals

- **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects**
  - Understand file formats and parsing techniques for data extraction.
  - Use file I/O classes to read data and convert it into object attributes.
  - Handle exceptions and ensure data integrity during object instantiation.

- **Designing Classes**
  - Identify class responsibilities and define clear interfaces.
  - Implement cohesive class structures with appropriate fields and methods.
  - Leverage design patterns to solve common problems and enhance class design.

- **Programming Creatively**
  - Explore different approaches to problem-solving and algorithm design.
  - Encourage experimentation and iteration to refine solutions.
  - Integrate user feedback and testing to improve program effectiveness and usability.

### üìö Exercise 1: Understanding File Formats and Parsing Techniques

Focus on the theory of reading from files:

1. **Question:** Explain the difference between CSV, JSON, and XML file formats. What are the typical use cases for each?
2. **Question:** Describe the steps involved in parsing a text file to extract relevant data programmatically.

### üìö Exercise 2: Principles of Class Design

Dive into the theoretical aspects of designing classes:

1. **Question:** Discuss the principles of object-oriented design (OOD) and how they can be applied to class design in Java.
2. **Question:** Explain the importance of encapsulation and class interfaces in maintaining software scalability and maintainability.

### üîß Exercise 3: Implementing File-Based Object Instantiation

In this exercise, you'll begin coding. Implement a basic game setup:

1. **Task:** Create a class `GameEntity` with fields for position, health, and type (e.g., player, enemy).
   
   ```java
   public class GameEntity {
       private int x;
       private int y;
       private int health;
       private String type;

       public GameEntity(int x, int y, int health, String type) {
           this.x = x;
           this.y = y;
           this.health = health;
           this.type = type;
       }
       // Getters and setters
   }
   ```

2. **Task:** Develop a method to read entity data from a CSV file and instantiate objects.

   ```java
   public static List<GameEntity> loadEntitiesFromFile(String filename) {
       List<GameEntity> entities = new ArrayList<>();
       // Implement file reading and object instantiation
       return entities;
   }
   ```

### üîß Exercise 4: Designing the Game World

Combine file data with creative class design to develop the game environment:

1. **Task:** Design a `GameWorld` class that manages `GameEntity` objects.
   
   ```java
   public class GameWorld {
       private List<GameEntity> entities;

       public GameWorld(String filename) {
           this.entities = loadEntitiesFromFile(filename);
       }

       // Methods to manipulate entities
   }
   ```

2. **Task:** Implement methods for `addEntity`, `removeEntity`, and `moveEntity` within `GameWorld`.

### üèÜ Exercise 5: Creating Dynamic Enemy Interactions

This advanced task will challenge your coding skills by adding dynamics to the game:

1. **Task:** Enhance `GameEntity` to include enemy behaviors, such as following or attacking the player.
2. **Task:** Use design patterns (e.g., Strategy pattern) to encapsulate different types of enemy behaviors.

   ```java
   interface Behavior {
       void execute(GameEntity entity);
   }

   class AggressiveBehavior implements Behavior {
       @Override
       public void execute(GameEntity entity) {
           // Implement attacking behavior
       }
   }
   ```

### üèÜ Exercise 6: Implementing Scoring and Player Movement

Finalize your game by adding a scoring system and player interaction:

1. **Task:** Implement a scoring system that rewards points based on player actions or defeating enemies.
2. **Task:** Add player controls to move within the game world, interact with enemies, and update the score accordingly.

### üéâ Conclusion

Congratulations on completing this task! You've not only developed a simple game application but also deepened your understanding of managing data from files, designing robust classes, and programming creatively to solve complex problems.
