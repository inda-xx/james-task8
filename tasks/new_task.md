### Task: Develop a Simple Game Application 📱🎮

Welcome to the challenge of developing your own simple game application! This task will test your ability to handle Java classes, manage object orientation, and leverage creativity. The game should integrate functionalities like player movement, a scoring system, and enemy interactions. Throughout this project, you'll gain hands-on experience in using data from files to instantiate objects, designing classes efficiently, and programming creatively.

#### Learning Goals 📚

1. **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects**
   - Understand file formats and parsing methods for data extraction.
   - Use file I/O classes to read and convert data into object attributes.
   - Handle exceptions and ensure data integrity during object instantiation.

2. **Designing Classes**
   - Define class responsibilities and establish clear interfaces.
   - Implement cohesive class structures with appropriate fields and methods.
   - Employ design patterns to solve common problems and improve class design.

3. **Programming Creatively**
   - Explore various approaches to problem-solving and algorithm design.
   - Encourage experimentation and iteration to refine solutions.
   - Integrate user feedback and testing to enhance program effectiveness and usability.

### Exercise 1: Concepts of File Handling in Java 📃🔍

**Objective**: Understand the theoretical aspects of file handling in Java.

**Description**: Research and explain the following concepts:
- Different file formats and their structures.
- Parsing techniques for extracting data from files.
- Common file I/O classes in Java and their purposes.

**Instructions**:
- Write a brief summary (around 300 words) covering the above points.
- Use examples and diagrams where appropriate to illustrate your points.

### Exercise 2: Class Design Principles in Object-Oriented Programming 🏗️🔑

**Objective**: Develop a theoretical understanding of class design principles in Java.

**Description**: Explain the following concepts:
- How to identify class responsibilities and define interfaces.
- The importance of cohesive class structures.
- Examples of design patterns and their applications.

**Instructions**:
- Provide a succinct explanation (around 300–400 words) on the above topics.
- Use class diagrams to illustrate your points where applicable.

### Exercise 3: Implementing File Data to Object Instantiation ⚙️📝

**Objective**: Implement file data reading to create game entities.

**Instructions**:
1. **Create a `GameLoader` class**:
   - Write a method `loadEntities(String filename)` that reads game entities from a file.
   - Ensure the file includes data for player and enemies with attributes like position, health, and speed.
   - Instantiate these entities into appropriate objects.

**Code Snippet**:
```java
public class GameLoader {
    public List<Entity> loadEntities(String filename) {
        // Implement file reading and object instantiation
    }
}
```
- Ensure you handle file I/O exceptions and verify data integrity.

### Exercise 4: Designing Core Game Classes 🕹️🏎️

**Objective**: Design and implement core game classes for your application.

**Instructions**:
1. **Design the following classes**:
   - `Player`: Contains fields like `position`, `speed`, and `score`.
   - `Enemy`: Includes attributes such as `position`, `speed`, and `damage`.
   - `Game`: Manages the main logic and interactions between `Player` and `Enemy`.

2. **Implement methods in each class**, ensuring:
   - Player can move and interact with enemies.
   - Score increases upon player’s successful actions.

**Code Snippet**:
```java
public class Player {
    private int position;
    private int speed;
    private int score;
    // Movement and scoring methods
}

public class Enemy {
    private int position;
    private int speed;
    private int damage;
    // Enemy behavior methods
}
```

### Exercise 5: Integrate Scoring and Player Movement 🏃🏽‍♂️🔢

**Objective**: Implement and test the player movement and scoring mechanics.

**Instructions**:
1. **Develop a `GameEngine` class**:
   - Implement methods to handle user input for player movement.
   - Update the player’s position based on input and speed.

2. **Manage the scoring system**:
   - Create a scoring method that updates based on player actions interacting with enemies.

**Step-by-Step**:
- Implement input handling for player movements (e.g., arrow keys).
- Test movement responsiveness and ensure positions update correctly.
- Implement unit tests to validate the scoring updates.

---

### Exercise 6: Creating Enemy Interactions and Final Game Testing ⚔️🎯

**Objective**: Develop complex interactions with enemies and conduct comprehensive testing.

**Instructions**:
1. **Extend the `GameEngine` class**:
   - Develop enemy interactions where the player can attack and defeat enemies.
   - Create conditions for game-over or level completion based on player health and enemy status.

2. **Finalize the Game with Testing**:
   - Integrate feedback mechanisms (e.g., displaying scores, health status).
   - Conduct thorough testing and debugging to ensure smooth gameplay and correct score tracking.

**Step-by-Step**:
- Implement an attack mechanism (player vs. enemy).
- Integrate conditions and feedback for runtime interactions.
- Execute comprehensive test cases to ensure gameplay is free of bugs.
