### 🎮 Programming Project: Create a Simple Game Application

Welcome to your next programming challenge! In this project, you will create a simple game application. This game will involve player movement, a scoring system, and enemy interactions. Throughout the project, you will learn to use data from files to instantiate objects, design well-structured classes, and exercise creative programming. 

#### Learning Goals

1. **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects**
   - Understand file formats and parsing techniques for data extraction.
   - Utilize file I/O classes to read data and convert it into object attributes.
   - Manage exceptions and ensure data integrity during object instantiation.

2. **Designing Classes**
   - Identify class responsibilities and define clear interfaces.
   - Implement cohesive class structures with appropriate fields and methods.
   - Apply design patterns to solve common problems and enhance class design.

3. **Programming Creatively**
   - Explore different approaches to problem-solving and algorithm design.
   - Encourage experimentation and iteration to refine solutions.
   - Integrate user feedback and testing to improve program effectiveness and usability.

### 📋 Exercise List

#### Exercise 1: Understanding Data in Games 📄

**Objective**: Gain theoretical understanding of how data from files can be used in games.

- **Task**: Write a short essay (about 300 words) explaining how games use external data files for different elements like levels, character stats, or configurations. Focus on the benefits of using such data, such as flexibility and ease of updates.

#### Exercise 2: Class Design Principles 📘

**Objective**: Explore theoretical aspects of class design in games.

- **Task**: In a hypothetical game of your choice, outline three classes you would design. Describe their responsibilities, methods, and how they interact with each other. Discuss how you would ensure these classes are extendable and maintainable.

#### Exercise 3: Creating Game Objects from Data 💾

**Objective**: Use file data to instantiate game objects in Java.

- **Task**: Write a `GameLevelLoader` class that reads level configuration from a text file and constructs `Enemy` objects with attributes like position and speed. Use a text file like `levels.txt` where each line contains enemy configurations. Use parsing techniques and handle exceptions to manage file reading.

    ```java
    public class GameLevelLoader {
        private List<Enemy> enemies = new ArrayList<>();

        public GameLevelLoader(String filename) {
            // Implement file reading and Enemy instantiation here
        }
        
        public List<Enemy> getEnemies() {
            return enemies;
        }
    }
    ```

#### Exercise 4: Designing the Game Entity Classes 🏗️

**Objective**: Design player and enemy classes with proper OOP techniques.

- **Task**: Implement `Player` and `Enemy` classes. Ensure each class has methods for movement and interacting with the game environment. Use design principles to ensure these classes are cleanly structured and easily testable.

    ```java
    public class Player {
        private int x, y;
        
        public void move(int deltaX, int deltaY) {
            // Implement movement logic
        }
        
        // Additional methods related to player actions
    }
    
    public class Enemy {
        private int x, y, speed;
        
        public void move() {
            // Implement movement logic based on speed
        }
        
        // Additional methods related to enemy actions
    }
    ```

#### Exercise 5: Implementing the Scoring System and Game State 🚀

**Objective**: Develop a scoring system and manage game state.

- **Task**: Create a `Game` class that tracks player scores and game state (like win/loss conditions). Integrate it with the `Player` and `Enemy` classes. Ensure the game updates its state based on interactions (e.g., player defeating an enemy increases score).

    ```java
    public class Game {
        private int score;
        private Player player;
        private List<Enemy> enemies;
        
        public void update() {
            // Implement game state updating logic
        }
        
        public void addScore(int points) {
            score += points;
        }
        
        // Additional methods to manage the game state
    }
    ```

#### Exercise 6: Enhancing the Game with Creative Features 🎨

**Objective**: Integrate creative gameplay elements and refine your game.

- **Task**: Add creative features such as power-ups or environmental obstacles. Allow players to provide feedback or test new features, and then refine your implementation. Document the creative process and the changes made.
