## 🕹️ Simple Game Application: Player Movement, Scoring, and Enemy Interactions

Welcome to the exciting world of game development! In this task, you'll create a simple game application that integrates player movement, a scoring system, and enemy interactions. This will give you hands-on experience with file-based data, class design, and creative programming. You'll progress through a series of exercises, gaining new skills and confidence along the way. Let's design, implement, and have fun while learning!

### 🎯 Learning Goals

- **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects**
  - Understand file formats and parsing techniques.
  - Use file I/O classes to initialize objects.
  - Handle exceptions to ensure data integrity.

- **Designing Classes**
  - Identify class responsibilities and define interfaces.
  - Implement cohesive class structures.
  - Leverage design patterns.

- **Programming Creatively**
  - Explore different approaches to problem-solving.
  - Experiment and iterate to refine solutions.
  - Integrate user feedback for refinement.

## 🚀 Exercises

### Exercise 1: 📂 Understanding File Structures and Formats

**Objective:** Establish a foundational understanding of file operations and how data can be structured.

**Tasks:**
1. Research common data formats (e.g., CSV, JSON) used in games for saving levels, high scores, and configurations.
2. Explain how you would parse a simple configuration file to extract player attributes like speed and health.

**Hints:** Focus on the key differences between text and binary file encoding.

**Expected Outcome:** Clear explanations illustrating your understanding of file parsing techniques.

### Exercise 2: 📐 Class Design and Responsibilities

**Objective:** Grasp the fundamentals of good class design in Java.

**Tasks:**
1. List potential classes needed for the game (e.g., Player, Enemy, GameLevel).
2. For each class, write a brief description of its responsibilities and interaction with other classes.

**Hints:** Think about how each class can be extended or modified later.

**Expected Outcome:** A cohesive class responsibility chart.

### Exercise 3: 🏃‍♂️ Implementing Player Movement

**Objective:** Create a basic player movement system using object-oriented concepts.

**Tasks:**
1. Design a class `Player` with attributes like position, speed, and direction.
2. Implement methods to move the player based on keyboard input.

```java
public class Player {
    private int x, y;
    private int speed;

    public Player(int startX, int startY, int initialSpeed) {
        this.x = startX;
        this.y = startY;
        this.speed = initialSpeed;
    }

    public void move(String direction) {
        // Logic for updating position based on direction and speed
    }
}
```

**Expected Outcome:** A functional `Player` class that reacts to input to move on the screen.

### Exercise 4: 📊 Building a Scoring System

**Objective:** Develop a scoring system that interacts with player actions.

**Tasks:**
1. Create a `ScoreManager` class to track and update the score based on player achievements.
2. Integrate this scoring system with player interactions, such as collecting an item.

```java
public class ScoreManager {
    private int score;

    public void addPoints(int points) {
        score += points;
    }

    public int getScore() {
        return score;
    }
}
```

**Expected Outcome:** A dynamic scoring system that updates based on gameplay.

### Exercise 5: 👾 Enemy Interactions and File-Based Data

**Objective:** Use file data to instantiate game enemies and manage interactions.

**Tasks:**
1. Design an `Enemy` class and use a configuration file to instantiate multiple enemies with attributes.
2. Implement collision detection between the player and enemies to trigger score changes.

```java
public class Enemy {
    private int x, y;

    public Enemy(int startX, int startY) {
        this.x = startX;
        this.y = startY;
    }

    public static List<Enemy> loadFromFile(String filepath) {
        // Read from file and instantiate enemies
    }
}
```

**Expected Outcome:** A robust system where enemies are dynamically spawned and interact with the player effectively.

### Exercise 6: 🎨 Creative Game Enhancement

**Objective:** Use creativity to enhance game mechanics and user experience.

**Tasks:**
1. Explore ways to add new features such as power-ups or challenges.
2. Gather feedback from peers and iterate on game features for improvements.

**Expected Outcome:** An enriched game with new features and user-friendly enhancements.
