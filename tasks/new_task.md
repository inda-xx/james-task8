# üéÆ Game Development Project: Building a Simple Game Application

Welcome to your new programming adventure! In this task, you are going to build a simple game application designed to hone your skills in Java programming, focusing on the integration of player movement, scoring systems, and enemy interactions. This project will involve using data from files to instantiate objects, crafting well-designed classes, and engaging in creative coding.

## Learning Goals

- **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects**: Learn how to read data from files to create and initialize objects dynamically within your game.
- **Designing Classes**: Understand principles of designing structured and scalable classes essential for building complex systems.
- **Programming Creatively**: Challenge yourself to think outside the box and develop innovative solutions to create an engaging and functional game experience.

## Task Overview

Your task is divided into a series of exercises that will guide you through the process of creating your game step-by-step. Each exercise is designed to build upon the previous ones, gradually increasing in complexity and depth.

## üìù Exercise 1: Understanding File Data in Game Design

### Goal
To help you get started with file data handling, first focus on understanding different file formats and how they can be used to support dynamic data in games.

### Instructions
1. **Research File Formats**: Investigate common file formats used in games for storing data, such as JSON and XML. How do they differ, and what are their pros and cons?
2. **Data Parsing Techniques**: Write a short essay (300 words) discussing how data parsing is essential in game development, with examples of scenarios where parsing is used.

## üìù Exercise 2: Class Design Theory in Gaming Context

### Goal
Develop a strong understanding of class design principles and how they apply to video game architecture.

### Instructions
1. **Identify Class Responsibilities**: Describe the different responsibilities a player, an enemy, and a game manager class might have in a game.
2. **Design Patterns**: Research at least two design patterns that could be useful in game design. Discuss their potential impacts on game maintainability and scalability.

## üíª Exercise 3: Implementing Data-Driven Player Objects

### Goal
Begin coding by creating player objects using data from external files.

### Instructions
1. **Create a `Player` Class**:
   - Define the player‚Äôs attributes such as name, health, and position.
   - Implement a basic constructor.

2. **Using File Data**:
   - Write a method to read player configurations from a file (e.g., `players.json`).
   - Use this data to instantiate player objects.

#### Code Snippet Example
```java
public class Player {
    private String name;
    private int health;
    private int positionX;
    private int positionY;

    public Player(String name, int health, int positionX, int positionY) {
        this.name = name;
        this.health = health;
        this.positionX = positionX;
        this.positionY = positionY;
    }
    
    public static List<Player> loadPlayersFromFile(String filename) {
        // Implement file reading and parsing logic here.
    }
}
```

## üíª Exercise 4: Designing the Enemy Class with Dynamic Instantiation

### Goal
Extend your game by implementing enemies with dynamic data instantiation.

### Instructions
1. **Design an `Enemy` Class**:
   - Similar to the player class, define attributes like type, damage, and position.
   
2. **Dynamic Object Creation**:
   - Include a method to instantiate enemies from a file (e.g., `enemies.xml`).

3. **Exception Handling**:
   - Ensure data integrity by incorporating necessary exception handling.

## üéØ Exercise 5: Integrating Player Movement and Scoring System

### Goal
Implement fundamental features: player movement logic and a scoring system.

### Instructions
1. **Player Movement**:
   - Develop methods to update the player's position based on input.
   - Use `ArrayList<String>` to maintain logs of player movements for debugging.

2. **Scoring System**:
   - Introduce a scoring system class that keeps track of player's points.
   - Update the score based on interactions, e.g., collecting items or defeating enemies.

---

## üéØ Exercise 6: Bringing It All Together ‚Äì Enemy Interaction

### Goal
Build upon your existing code to create meaningful enemy interactions.

### Instructions
1. **Enemy Interaction Logic**:
   - Implement logic for what happens when a player encounters an enemy, like reducing health or increasing the score.

2. **Test the Game**:
   - Develop a simple testing scenario or environment to test player movements, interactions, and scoring.

3. **Creative Enhancements**:
   - Add at least one creative feature to your game. This could be visual effects using ASCII art in the console, more complex enemy behavior, or an enhanced scoring mechanic.
