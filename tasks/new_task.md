## ðŸš€ Journey Through Deep Space: A Programming Adventure

Welcome to the cosmic adventure, where you'll navigate the realms of object-oriented programming and creative coding. You are tasked to create a simulation of a deep space journey where spacecrafts traverse different sections of space, fueled by data from external files. This task strengthens your skills in handling data files, designing classes, and implementing creative solutions.

### Learning Goals:

1. **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects**: Master reading and parsing data from files to dynamically create and initialize objects, essential for adaptable applications.
2. **Designing Classes**: Focus on constructing well-structured classes following object-oriented principles for scalable and maintainable code.
3. **Programming Creatively**: Employ creativity to devise unique solutions and enhance software functionality and user interaction.

### Exercise Set:

### ðŸ“š Exercise 1: Understanding Data Files

**Objective:** Explore different file formats and parsing strategies for object instantiation.

- **Task 1.1**: Research common data file formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, XML) and their use cases.
- **Task 1.2**: Explain how these formats can be parsed to extract information and used in initializing Java objects.

#### ðŸ’¡ Questions:
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of using each file format for data parsing?
- How does the choice of file format impact the design of a system?

### ðŸ§© Exercise 2: The Art of Class Design

**Objective:** Deepen your understanding of class design and its role in object-oriented programming.

- **Task 2.1**: Discuss the fundamental principles of class design, such as the Single Responsibility Principle and the importance of encapsulation.
- **Task 2.2**: Identify a common design pattern (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer) and describe how it solves a recurring problem in software design.

#### ðŸ’¡ Questions:
- Why is it crucial to define clear interfaces when designing classes?
- How can design patterns contribute to the robustness of software systems?

### ðŸ¤– Exercise 3: Building the Spacecraft Class

**Objective:** Design a `Spacecraft` class utilizing data from a file to model a spaceship's properties and functions.

- **Task 3.1**: Create a `Spacecraft` class with attributes such as `name`, `speed`, `fuelLevel`, and `destination`.
- **Task 3.2**: Write a method `loadFromFile(String filename)` that reads a CSV file and initializes `Spacecraft` objects, handling exceptions gracefully.

#### Example CSV:
```plaintext
name,speed,fuelLevel,destination
Apollo,30000,100,Mars
Endeavour,28000,95,Moon
```

### ðŸŒŒ Exercise 4: Crafting the Galaxy

**Objective:** Design and implement a `Galaxy` class representing a collection of `Spacecraft` objects.

- **Task 4.1**: Design the `Galaxy` class, implementing methods to add or remove spacecraft, and list all current spacecraft.
- **Task 4.2**: Implement `populateFromFile(String filename)` to read spacecraft data from a file, instantiating and adding them to the galaxy.

### ðŸš€ Exercise 5: Interactive Space Simulator

**Objective:** Develop an interactive simulation where the user can control and explore the galaxy with their spacecraft.

- **Task 5.1**: Extend your application to allow user commands such as `view`, `launch`, and `refuel`, processing them through a console interface.
- **Task 5.2**: Implement a method that simulates travel of spacecraft, adjusting fuel levels based on distances to destinations, and prompting user feedback through console interactions.

### ðŸŒ  Exercise 6: A Journey Beyond

**Objective:** Push the boundaries of your simulation with a creative feature or innovation.

- **Task 6.1**: Think creatively to add an innovative element to your simulation. Suggestions include implementing a fuel economy system based on spacecraft efficiency or allowing in-simulation trading of resources.
- **Task 6.2**: Ensure that your new features integrate seamlessly with existing functionality and enhance the user experience.

**Deliverables for Exercises 5 & 6:**

1. Fully functional Java code for the described classes and methods.
2. A text file containing your data set (e.g., a list of spacecraft).
3. Documentation explaining your program architecture and additional features, using Javadoc comments.

### ðŸš€ Final Note:
Remember, the journey in deep space is vast and full of possibilities. Approach each task creatively and methodically, ensuring you implement robust and efficient solutions. Good luck, cadet, as you venture into the unknown territories of programming and design!
