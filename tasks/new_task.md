# üéÆ Simple Adventure Game Application

Welcome to the Simple Adventure Game development task! In this project, you'll create a simple yet engaging interactive game application. The game will include player movement, a scoring system, and interactions with enemies. This multi-part task is designed to help you build strong programming foundations by integrating various essential concepts. Let's dive in!

### üåü Learning Goals

1. **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects**
   - Understand file formats and parsing techniques. 
   - Use file I/O classes to read and convert data into object attributes.
   - Handle exceptions and maintain data integrity during object instantiation.

2. **Designing Classes**
   - Identify class responsibilities and define clear interfaces.
   - Implement cohesive class structures with appropriate fields and methods.
   - Use design patterns to solve common problems and enhance class design.

3. **Programming Creatively**
   - Explore different approaches to problem-solving and algorithm design.
   - Encourage experimentation and iteration to refine solutions.
   - Integrate user feedback and testing to improve program effectiveness and usability.

## Task Description

Your main objective is to create a game where a player navigates a 2D grid, collecting points while avoiding or interacting with enemies. The grid, populated by data from a file, will determine the initial positions of all elements.

## Exercise 1: üîç Understanding Data from Files

**Objective:** Develop a theoretical understanding of how data can be used to instantiate objects.

### Instructions:
1. **Concept Exploration:** 
   - Explain different file formats (e.g., CSV, JSON) that could be used to store game configurations (like grid layouts, player and enemy positions, etc.).
   - Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each format.

2. **Parsing Techniques:**
   - Describe how you would parse a sample file to extract game-related data.
   - Consider edge cases and how you would handle incorrect or malformed data.

## Exercise 2: üß† Class Design Concepts

**Objective:** Lay the groundwork for designing cohesive and effective classes for your game.

### Instructions:
1. **Class Responsibilities:**
   - Identify potential classes needed for the game (e.g., Player, Enemy, GameGrid).
   - Outline the main responsibilities of each class and interactions between them.

2. **Designing Effective Interfaces:**
   - Discuss how to design interfaces for these classes.
   - Consider how your design ensures flexibility for future feature additions, like new types of enemies or power-ups.

## Exercise 3: üíª File I/O and Object Instantiation

**Objective:** Implement the functionality to read game configuration data from a file and instantiate objects accordingly.

### Instructions:
1. **Data File Setup:**
   - Create a file (e.g., `game_config.txt`) with a sample grid layout. Each character represents a different game element (P for Player, E for Enemy, . for Empty space).

2. **Implement File Reader:**
   - Write a Java class, `GameConfigReader`, that reads this file and creates initial game elements.
   ```java
   public class GameConfigReader {
       public void loadGameConfig(String filename) {
           // Implement File I/O logic here
       }
   }
   ```
   - Ensure exception handling is integrated to handle any potential file read errors gracefully.

## Exercise 4: üèóÔ∏è Build the Initial Classes

**Objective:** Translate your class design into practical Java code.

### Instructions:
1. **Implement Core Classes:**
   - Create classes `Player`, `Enemy`, and `GameGrid`.
   - Each class should have constructors and necessary methods (`move`, `interact`, etc.) based on the previously outlined interfaces.

2. **Define Relationships:**
   - Implement methods in `GameGrid` that handle placing and moving game characters.
   ```java
   public class GameGrid {
       // Define the grid structure and methods
       public void movePlayer(String direction) {
           // Update player position
       }
   }
   ```

---

## Exercise 5: üöÄ Integrate and Test Basic Mechanics

**Objective:** Combine previous steps to create functioning game mechanics and test them thoroughly.

### Instructions:
1. **Integration:**
   - Write a `GameEngine` class that integrates your previous work.
   - Allow players to move and interact with grid elements based on input commands.

2. **Testing:**
   - Create a simple command-line interface to test player movements and interactions.

3. **Code Snippet:**
   ```java
   public class GameEngine {
       public void startGame() {
           // Initialize GameGrid and start game loop
       }
   }
   ```
---

## Exercise 6: üé® Programming Creatively with Advanced Features

**Objective:** Expand your game creatively by adding new features and refining gameplay.

### Instructions:
1. **Implement Scoring:**
   - Introduce a scoring system that awards points for collecting items or defeating enemies.

2. **Enhance Interactions:**
   - Develop more complex enemy interactions, such as tracking the player.

3. **Experiment with Features:**
   - Implement additional features like power-ups or level progression.
   - Encourage iteration and user testing for feedback-driven refinement.

4. **Example Feature:**
   ```java
   public class PowerUp {
       public void activate(Player player) {
           // Define power-up behavior
       }
   }
   ```

By the end of this project, you'll have a robust understanding of using file data to build interactive applications, and you'll have developed a simple yet entertaining game from scratch. Good luck, and have fun coding! üéâ
