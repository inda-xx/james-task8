## üéÆ Simple Game Development Task

Welcome to your new challenge! In this task, you will create a simple game application that encompasses essential functionalities such as player movement, a scoring system, and enemy interactions. Through this project, you will strengthen your understanding of object instantiation using data from files, class design, and creative programming.

### Learning Goals:

- **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects**
  - Understanding file formats and parsing techniques for data extraction.
  - Using file I/O classes to read data and convert it into object attributes.
  - Handling exceptions and ensuring data integrity during object instantiation.

- **Designing Classes**
  - Identifying class responsibilities and defining clear interfaces.
  - Implementing cohesive class structures with appropriate fields and methods.
  - Leveraging design patterns to solve common problems and enhance class design.

- **Programming Creatively**
  - Exploring different approaches to problem-solving and algorithm design.
  - Encouraging experimentation and iteration to refine solutions.
  - Integrating user feedback and testing to improve program effectiveness and usability.

Let's dive into the exercises!

### üìù Exercise 1: Theoretical Foundations of File Handling

**Objective**: Understand the principles of reading data from files and instantiating objects.

**Tasks**:
1. Explain how different file formats (e.g., CSV, JSON) can be used to represent game data such as levels, scores, or enemy properties.
2. Describe how Java's file I/O classes can be employed to read game configuration data and instantiate game objects dynamically.

**Hint**: Consider how data integrity is maintained during file I/O operations.

### üß† Exercise 2: Class Design and Structure

**Objective**: Discuss class design principles in the context of a game application.

**Tasks**:
1. Outline the responsibilities of key classes in a game (e.g., `Player`, `Enemy`, `ScoreManager`).
2. Enumerate potential methods and fields for each class that align with good object-oriented design principles.

**Hint**: Think about how design patterns like Singleton or Observer might be applicable.

### üë®‚Äçüíª Exercise 3: Implementing Player Movement

**Objective**: Develop initial game functionality with a focus on player movement.

**Tasks**:
1. Design and implement a `Player` class with fields for position and methods like `moveLeft`, `moveRight`, `jump`.
2. Write a test application that allows keyboard input to move a player object on a simple console interface.

```java
public class Player {
    private int x, y;
    
    public Player(int startX, int startY) {
        this.x = startX;
        this.y = startY;
    }

    public void moveLeft() {
        x -= 1;
    }

    public void moveRight() {
        x += 1;
    }

    public void jump() {
        y += 5; // Example jump action
    }

    // Additional methods and fields as needed
}
```

### üîó Exercise 4: Scoring System via File Data

**Objective**: Use data from files to manage and display player scores.

**Tasks**:
1. Implement a `ScoreManager` class that reads initial game scores from a file and maintains scores during gameplay.
2. Write a method `updateScore(int value)` to adjust scores and `saveScoresToFile(String filename)` to persist scores.

```java
public class ScoreManager {
    private Map<String, Integer> scores;

    public ScoreManager(String filename) {
        scores = new HashMap<>();
        // Read scores from file logic
    }

    public void updateScore(String playerName, int value) {
        scores.merge(playerName, value, Integer::sum);
    }

    public void saveScoresToFile(String filename) {
        // Write scores to file logic
    }
}
```

---

### üó°Ô∏è Exercise 5: Enemy Interactions

**Objective**: Design and code enemy interactions within the game environment.

**Tasks**:
1. Create an `Enemy` class read from an enemy configuration file that contains attributes like health and position.
2. Implement enemy behavior such as movement toward the player and interactions with player actions.

**Guidance**: Ensure robust handling of file data, such as verifying format and handling exceptions.

--- 

### üöÄ Exercise 6: Full Game Integration and Creative Enhancement

**Objective**: Bring all components together into a cohesive game application.

**Tasks**:
1. Integrate `Player`, `ScoreManager`, and `Enemy` classes in a single game loop, allowing for real-time interaction.
2. Implement a basic graphical interface using a library like JavaFX or Swing to display the game.
3. Add at least one creative feature, such as power-ups, multiple levels, or enhanced graphics.

**Challenge**: Use creative problem-solving to enrich your game's features and address any bugs or performance issues.

#### üåü Extra Challenge: User Feedback and Iterative Design

Enhance your game based on peer feedback. Conduct a short session where peers can play your game and provide insights. Incorporate these suggestions to refine gameplay and usability, showcasing your ability to iterate and improve upon initial developments.
