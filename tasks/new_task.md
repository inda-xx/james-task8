### üéÆ Create a Simple Game Application: Player Movement, Scoring System, and Enemy Interactions

**Introduction**

Welcome to the exciting world of game development! In this task, you will design and implement a simple game application featuring a player character that can move around, a scoring system that rewards player achievements, and interactions with enemies. The ultimate objective of this task is to harness the power of Java programming and apply your creativity to bring a game to life.

This challenge will guide you through crucial object-oriented programming concepts, using data from files to instantiate objects and encourage creative problem-solving.

### Learning Goals

- **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects**
  - Understanding file formats and parsing techniques for data extraction.
  - Using file I/O classes to read data and convert it into object attributes.
  - Handling exceptions and ensuring data integrity during object instantiation.

- **Designing Classes**
  - Identifying class responsibilities and defining clear interfaces.
  - Implementing cohesive class structures with appropriate fields and methods.
  - Leveraging design patterns to solve common problems and enhance class design.

- **Programming Creatively**
  - Exploring different approaches to problem-solving and algorithm design.
  - Encouraging experimentation and iteration to refine solutions.
  - Integrating user feedback and testing to improve program effectiveness and usability.

### üìù Task Structure

### **Exercise 1: Theoretical Exploration of Data from Files**

üëâ **Objective**: Understand how Java can use data from files to create and initialize objects.

- **Task**: Research and write a short essay on the importance of using data from files to instantiate objects. Explain how different file formats (e.g., CSV, JSON) are parsed and utilized in Java applications.

- **Key Points to Address**:
  - Common file I/O operations in Java.
  - Techniques for parsing data files.
  - Advantages of using file-based object instantiation in game development.

### **Exercise 2: Concepts of Class Design**

üëâ **Objective**: Grasp the principles of designing well-structured Java classes.

- **Task**: Identify and list the responsibilities and interfaces you would assign to the following classes for a simple game: `Player`, `Enemy`, `Game`, and `Scoreboard`.

- **Key Points to Consider**:
  - Cohesion and encapsulation.
  - Class interaction and communication.
  - The potential of using design patterns for future expansion.

### **Exercise 3: Hands-On Data Handling**

üëâ **Objective**: Implement reading data from a file to initialize objects.

- **Task**: Write Java code to read player attributes (e.g., name, speed, position) from a CSV file and create `Player` objects. Use exception handling to manage file operations and data integrity.

```java
public class Player {
    private String name;
    private int speed;
    private int positionX;
    private int positionY;

    public Player(String name, int speed, int positionX, int positionY) {
        this.name = name;
        this.speed = speed;
        this.positionX = positionX;
        this.positionY = positionY;
    }
    // Getters and other methods
}
```

- **Key Challenges**:
  - File I/O operations and parsing.
  - Object instantiation and exception handling.

### **Exercise 4: Building the Game Classes**

üëâ **Objective**: Implement basic class structures for the game.

- **Task**: Create the `Player`, `Enemy`, `Game`, and `Scoreboard` classes in Java with fundamental methods for movement and scoring. 

- **Hints**:
  - Use encapsulation for fields like `health` on the `Player` and `Enemy` classes.
  - Implement simple methods like `move()` in `Player` for position changes.

```java
public class Game {
    private List<Player> players;
    private List<Enemy> enemies;

    public Game(List<Player> players, List<Enemy> enemies) {
        this.players = players;
        this.enemies = enemies;
    }

    public void start() {
        // Game loop logic
    }
}
```

### **Exercise 5: Enemy Interactions and Scoring**

üëâ **Objective**: Develop the interaction mechanism between players and enemies, and implement a scoring system.

- **Task**: Write code to allow player collision with enemies and update the score based on these interactions.

- **Key Components**:
  - Define a `collide()` method in `Player` that checks if a player has touched an enemy.
  - Implement a `updateScore(int points)` method in the `Scoreboard` class.

### **Exercise 6: Final Integration and Creative Enhancements**

üëâ **Objective**: Integratively enhance the game by adding features and improving existing ones.

- **Task**: Finalize your game by integrating all classes and adding at least one creative feature, such as power-ups or a settings menu for customization.

- **Suggestions**:
  - Consider a simple user interface for better user interaction.
  - Implement various difficulty levels by adjusting enemy speed or number.

### üèÅ Conclusion

Upon completion, you'll have created a simple, yet fully functional game application in Java. Each exercise builds upon the last, culminating in an integrated system showcasing your understanding of object-oriented design, file management, and creativity in programming. Remember to test your game thoroughly and seek feedback to make refinements. Happy coding!
