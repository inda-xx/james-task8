### 🎮 Simple Game Application: Enemy Interactions and Scoring 🎮

Welcome to the world of game development! In this task, you will design and implement a simple 2D game application that showcases player movement, a scoring system, and enemy interactions. This project will test your understanding of essential programming concepts such as object instantiation from files, class design, and creative problem-solving.

#### **🎯 Learning Goals**
- **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects**
  - Understand file formats and parsing techniques for data extraction.
  - Use file I/O classes to read data and convert it into object attributes.
  - Handle exceptions and ensure data integrity during object instantiation.
  
- **Designing Classes**
  - Identify class responsibilities and define clear interfaces.
  - Implement cohesive class structures with appropriate fields and methods.
  - Leverage design patterns to solve common problems and enhance class design.

- **Programming Creatively**
  - Explore different approaches to problem-solving and algorithm design.
  - Encourage experimentation and iteration to refine solutions.
  - Integrate user feedback and testing to improve program effectiveness and usability.

### 📝 Exercise 1: Theoretical Foundations of Files and Data Parsing

**Objective:** You will explore the theoretical concepts of using data from files to instantiate objects.

**Task:**  
- **Question 1:** Describe the process of reading data from a file and using it to create and initialize objects in Java. Mention any common file formats used and parsing techniques.
- **Question 2:** Discuss the importance of exception handling while dealing with file I/O in Java and how it affects data integrity during object instantiation.

**Expected Output:** A detailed document responding to the questions, demonstrating your understanding of file handling and data parsing.

### 📝 Exercise 2: Theoretical Exploration of Class Design

**Objective:** Gain insights into the art of designing effective classes.

**Task:**  
- **Question 1:** Explain how to identify class responsibilities and define interfaces in object-oriented design.
- **Question 2:** Describe the principles of cohesion in class structures and how design patterns can enhance class design and maintainability.

**Expected Output:** A comprehensive essay on class responsibilities, interfaces, cohesion, and the application of design patterns.

### 💻 Exercise 3: Implementing Basic Game Entities

**Objective:** Create the foundational classes for your game.

**Task:** Implement the following classes:
- **Player:** Represents the player character. Include fields for position, score, and methods for movement and score updates.
- **Enemy:** Represents enemies that the player interacts with. Include fields for position and methods for movement.

**Expected Output:** Well-defined Java classes for `Player` and `Enemy` with basic attributes and methods implemented. Include comments explaining each section of your code.

---

### 💻 Exercise 4: Load Game Entities from File

**Objective:** Load player and enemy configurations from external files to dynamically create game objects.

**Task:**  
- Create a method in your main game application class that reads player and enemy data from separate configuration files (e.g., `player.txt` and `enemies.txt`).
- Use this data to instantiate `Player` and `Enemy` objects. Ensure to handle any potential exceptions and validate the data integrity.

**Expected Output:** Fully functional code that can instantiate multiple game objects from file data. Include a demonstration scenario in your `main` method to verify that objects are correctly loaded and instantiated.

### 🚀 Exercise 5: Enhancing Gameplay with Scoring and Interactions

**Objective:** Implement the game's scoring mechanism and basic enemy-player interactions.

**Task:**  
- Add a scoring system to the `Player` class, increasing the score when certain conditions are met (e.g., when the player avoids an enemy or collects an item).
- Implement simple enemy behavior, such as moving towards the player or patrolling back and forth.

**Expected Output:** A running game environment where the player can move, score points when interacting with enemies, and encounter basic enemy AI. Test the interactions thoroughly to ensure robustness.

---

### 🚀 Exercise 6: Expanding with Creative Features

**Objective:** Integrate creative elements and improve the overall gaming experience.

**Task:**  
- Introduce a new feature: a power-up item that temporarily increases the player's speed or allows the player to eliminate enemies.
- Collect feedback from at least two other students on your gameplay, and iterate on your design based on this feedback to improve usability and engagement.

**Expected Output:** An enhanced game application showcasing polished gameplay with additional features. Document the feedback received and the changes you implemented, and include a video clip or screenshots of the enhanced gameplay experience.
